# SAS2R_Intro
Focus on translating basic SAS processes into R with the intent to help epidemiologist and clinical researchers shift into a Big Data workflow and utilize open-source tooling through R. 

This basic guide will walk someone through multiple steps in their data processing and analytics workflow. This is not intended to be a comprehensive look at all the amazing things that can be done with R; however, it should cover the elements necessary to get started and familiar with the tool. 

Basics we will cover include: 

- Data Cleaning 
- Data Sorting 
- Basic Analysis
- Regressions 
- Graphs and Graphics
- Reporting 
- File Types
- Working Across Platforms

With this in mind, we can dive into the wonderful world of R and learn how to make the transition from SAS more smooth. 


Note: at the time of making this I am working in a public health context as an epidemiologist with LA County. As such, some elements or examples may skew in this direction; however, this page is meant to be more broadly applicable.
